# Unentropy Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Serverless Architecture
All components must be serverless and operate within GitHub Actions workflows. No external servers or cloud services required for core functionality.

### II. Technology Stack Consistency
Use Bun runtime with TypeScript for implementation, SQLite for data storage, and Chart.js for report generation. Use Bun as the package manager (NOT npm). Maintain consistency across the project.

### III. Code Quality Standards
Enforce strict TypeScript types, use Prettier for formatting, and avoid unnecessary comments unless explicitly requested. Follow existing code conventions.

### IV. Security Best Practices
Never log or expose secrets and keys. Follow security guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities.

### V. Testing Discipline
Implement comprehensive tests including unit, integration, and contract tests. Run lint, typecheck, and tests in CI pipeline.

## Additional Constraints

The project must remain lightweight and self-contained. No dependencies on external services beyond GitHub Actions. Ensure compatibility with CI/CD environments.

## Development Workflow

All changes require code review. Run build, lint, typecheck, and tests before merging. Follow semantic versioning for releases.

## Governance

Amendments to this constitution require consensus from maintainers. Version increments follow semantic versioning rules. Compliance must be verified in all PRs.
