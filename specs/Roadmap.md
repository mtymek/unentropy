# Unentropy Roadmap

## 0.1
* [x] MVP
* [x] Using GitHub action artifact for storing the metrics database
* [ ] A single, convinient GH action that does it all - downloads db from GH artifact, runs analysis, uploads results to GH artifact
* [ ] Support for S3-compatible storage 

## Concepts
* Using Bun build as templating engine. Should reduce the amount of code needed to generate the HTML report.
* Support for more robust, cloud databases (Postgres, MySQL, ...)

## Long term ideas
* Browsing the coverage report
