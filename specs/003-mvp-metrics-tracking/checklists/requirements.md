# Specification Quality Checklist: MVP Metrics Tracking System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: Thu Oct 16 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Pass**: All quality criteria met. The specification is ready for planning phase.

### Review Details:

**Content Quality**: 
- ✓ Specification focuses on WHAT users need and WHY
- ✓ No technology-specific implementation details (e.g., mentions SQLite and Chart.js only as dependencies/assumptions, not implementation requirements)
- ✓ Written in business language accessible to non-technical stakeholders

**Requirement Completeness**:
- ✓ All 18 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- ✓ 7 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentage, count)
- ✓ Success criteria are user-focused (e.g., "Users can define custom metrics in under 5 minutes" vs "Config parser executes in X ms")
- ✓ Three complete user stories with acceptance scenarios covering configuration, collection, and reporting flows
- ✓ Edge cases identified for error scenarios, concurrency, and data states
- ✓ Scope boundaries clearly define what's in/out of MVP
- ✓ Dependencies and assumptions documented

**Feature Readiness**:
- ✓ Each functional requirement can be verified through the acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✓ User scenarios follow priority order (P1→P2→P3) with clear value justification
- ✓ All scenarios are independently testable as specified
- ✓ No implementation leakage detected

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan.
