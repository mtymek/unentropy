# Implementation Plan: Basic Project Scaffolding

**Branch**: `001-basic-scaffolding` | **Date**: 2025-10-16 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-basic-scaffolding/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create foundational project scaffolding with TypeScript and Bun runtime to enable immediate development with type checking, testing, linting, and build capabilities. Establish serverless-compatible structure for GitHub Actions integration.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9.3, Bun 1.3  
**Primary Dependencies**: ESLint 9.x, typescript-eslint 8.x, Prettier 3.x, Bun built-in test runner  
**Storage**: SQLite (per constitution, but not needed for scaffolding feature)  
**Testing**: Bun built-in test runner (Jest-compatible API, 10-30x faster)  
**Target Platform**: GitHub Actions (Linux), Node.js-compatible environments via Bun
**Project Type**: single (CLI/library tool for metrics tracking)  
**Performance Goals**: Build <5s, typecheck <5s, test suite <2s (per spec success criteria)  
**Constraints**: Serverless-only (per constitution), no external services, GitHub Actions compatible  
**Scale/Scope**: Initial scaffolding only - minimal codebase with sample test structure

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **I. Serverless Architecture** | ✅ PASS | Scaffolding supports GitHub Actions workflows; no external servers |
| **II. Technology Stack Consistency** | ✅ PASS | TypeScript enforced; will use Chart.js for future reports (not in scope); SQLite planned (not in scope) |
| **III. Code Quality Standards** | ✅ PASS | Strict TypeScript and Prettier required by spec (FR-002, FR-007) |
| **IV. Security Best Practices** | ✅ PASS | No secrets in scaffolding phase; patterns to be established |
| **V. Testing Discipline** | ✅ PASS | Testing framework required (FR-004, FR-008); CI integration planned (SC-005) |
| **Additional Constraints** | ✅ PASS | Lightweight, self-contained, GitHub Actions compatible |
| **Development Workflow** | ✅ PASS | Lint/typecheck/test commands required (FR-003) |

**Overall Gate Status**: ✅ PASS - All constitutional requirements met

**Post-Design Re-evaluation (Phase 1 Complete)**:
- ✅ I. Serverless Architecture: GitHub Actions workflow defined, no external servers
- ✅ II. Technology Stack Consistency: TypeScript 5.9.3 + Bun 1.3 selected, SQLite deferred to future features
- ✅ III. Code Quality Standards: ESLint strict + Prettier configs defined in contracts
- ✅ IV. Security Best Practices: No secrets in scaffolding; patterns established for future
- ✅ V. Testing Discipline: Bun test runner, unit/integration/contract structure, CI pipeline
- ✅ Additional Constraints: Lightweight (minimal deps), self-contained, GitHub Actions ready
- ✅ Development Workflow: All required commands (build, test, lint, typecheck) defined

**Final Gate Status**: ✅ PASS - Design maintains full constitutional compliance

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure selected. This is a CLI/library tool for code metrics tracking, not a web or mobile application. Directory structure follows FR-006 requirement for logical separation of source and tests. Test directories include unit, integration, and contract subdirectories per Constitution principle V (Testing Discipline).
