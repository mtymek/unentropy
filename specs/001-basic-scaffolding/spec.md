# Feature Specification: Basic Project Scaffolding

**Feature Branch**: `001-basic-scaffolding`  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Prepare the basic scaffolding. I want to use TypeScript and bun, I want to have tests working from the start. Select other required tech."

**Note**: This specification focuses on WHAT capabilities are needed, not HOW they are implemented. Technology choices (TypeScript, Bun) are implementation details for the planning phase.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developer Initializes Project (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to start building the Unentropy application with a properly configured development environment that supports static type checking, immediate test execution, and modern tooling.

**Why this priority**: Without the basic project structure and tooling, no development work can begin. This is the foundation for all subsequent features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by cloning the repository, running the build command, and executing the test suite. Delivers a working development environment with type checking and testing capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an empty repository, **When** the developer clones it and runs the build command, **Then** the source code compiles successfully with no errors
2. **Given** the project is set up, **When** the developer runs the test command, **Then** all tests execute and pass
3. **Given** the project structure is created, **When** the developer opens the project in an IDE with language support, **Then** type checking and autocomplete work correctly

---

### User Story 2 - Developer Modifies Code (Priority: P2)

A developer makes changes to the codebase and wants immediate feedback through type checking and test execution to ensure code quality.

**Why this priority**: This enables productive iterative development and prevents bugs from being introduced.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by modifying a source file, running type check and tests, and verifying that errors are caught and displayed appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the project is set up, **When** the developer introduces a type error in the code, **Then** the type checker identifies and reports the error with clear messages
2. **Given** a test file exists, **When** the developer runs tests in watch mode, **Then** tests automatically re-run when files change
3. **Given** code changes are made, **When** the developer runs the linter, **Then** code style violations are identified and reported

---

### User Story 3 - Developer Adds New Features (Priority: P3)

A developer creates new modules or features and wants to ensure they follow established patterns and integrate correctly with the existing codebase.

**Why this priority**: This ensures consistency and maintainability as the codebase grows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a new module with tests, and verifying it integrates seamlessly with the build and test infrastructure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the project structure is established, **When** the developer creates a new source file, **Then** it is automatically included in the build process
2. **Given** a new feature is implemented, **When** the developer writes tests for it, **Then** the tests are discovered and executed by the test runner
3. **Given** multiple source files exist, **When** the developer imports types or modules across files, **Then** module resolution works correctly

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer attempts to build with syntax errors in source files?
- How does the system handle missing dependencies?
- What occurs when tests fail during the build process?
- How does the environment handle version mismatches in dependencies?
- What feedback is provided when test files have syntax errors?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a package configuration file that declares all required dependencies
- **FR-002**: System MUST include configuration that enforces strict type checking
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide executable commands for building, testing, linting, and type checking
- **FR-004**: System MUST include automated testing capabilities with test discovery and execution
- **FR-005**: System MUST include code quality enforcement through linting
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a logical directory structure separating source code from tests
- **FR-007**: System MUST include configuration for consistent code formatting
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide sample test files demonstrating testing patterns
- **FR-009**: System MUST include documentation explaining setup instructions and available commands
- **FR-010**: System MUST support modern module syntax with proper import/export capabilities

### Key Entities

- **Project Configuration**: Metadata defining project name, version, dependencies, and executable commands
- **Language Configuration**: Settings for compilation target, module resolution, strict type checking, and output paths
- **Test Configuration**: Settings for test execution, coverage reporting, and test file patterns
- **Source Code Structure**: Organized directories for application code, tests, and type definitions

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can clone the repository and run all build commands successfully within 5 minutes
- **SC-002**: Type checking completes in under 5 seconds for the initial codebase
- **SC-003**: Test suite executes all tests in under 2 seconds with zero failures
- **SC-004**: 100% of committed code passes linting rules
- **SC-005**: All build, test, lint, and type check commands complete successfully in CI/CD environment
- **SC-006**: Documentation enables new developers to understand all available commands and project structure within 10 minutes of reading
