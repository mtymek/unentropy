# Specification Quality Checklist: Basic Project Scaffolding

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

âœ… **Specification Complete**: All validation checks passed. The specification is ready for planning phase.

**Validation Summary**:
- All mandatory sections completed with concrete details
- Requirements are technology-agnostic and testable
- Success criteria are measurable without implementation details
- User scenarios cover initialization, modification, and feature addition workflows
- Edge cases address error handling and dependency management
- No clarifications needed - scope is clear and bounded
