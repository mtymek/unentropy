# **Unentropy**

**Unentropy: CI/CD Codebase Health Tracking, Decoupled.**

*(The tendency of a complex codebase to increase in disorder is known as "code entropy." Unentropy aims to reverse that trend.)*

## **üí° What is Unentropy?**

**Unentropy** is an open-source tool designed to help engineering teams maintain and improve mid-sized to large, long-living codebases by relentlessly tracking **custom code metrics** right where the changes happen: in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

Unlike monolithic tools that require dedicated servers, cloud hosting, or complex infrastructure, **Unentropy is fully self-contained within your existing GitHub Actions workflow.** It provides a lightweight, serverless solution for historical data tracking and reporting.

## **üéØ The Problem Unentropy Solves**

As codebases mature, teams need to track custom, internal metrics specific to their business logic or technological evolution. This could range from simple counts to highly specific indicators generated by custom scripts.

1. **Tracking Custom Metrics:** Standard tools often don't support the highly custom, often *ad-hoc*, metrics critical for a specific project (e.g., "Ratio of Modern Framework usage to Legacy Code").
2. **Server Overhead:** Hosting and maintaining a dedicated service (like SonarQube or custom dashboards) just to track trends is significant overhead, especially for smaller or distributed teams.
3. **Data Persistence:** You need a simple, reliable way to persist historical metrics associated with specific commits, without adding another managed service.

## **üõ†Ô∏è How Unentropy Works**

Unentropy operates entirely within a GitHub workflow by following a simple three-step cycle:

1. **Fetch:** The Unentropy GitHub Action **downloads** the existing, historical metrics database from the latest successful run (saved as a GitHub Artifact).
2. **Collect & Update:** It executes your custom metric collection scripts, gathers the new data points (along with the current Git SHA and timestamp), and securely adds the new row to the database file.
3. **Report & Persist:** It generates a simple, **static HTML trend report** (with charts) and then **uploads both the updated database file and the report file** back as GitHub Artifacts, making them immediately available for download and review.

This allows teams to see trends, spot entropy spikes, and visualize codebase health over time, all without maintaining a single external server.

## **‚ú® Key Features (MVP Goals)**

* **Serverless Architecture:** No server, no cloud, no recurring fees. Everything lives in your repository's workflow artifacts.
* **Custom Metric Agnostic:** Easily consume key-value metrics generated by *any* script or custom tool you write.
* **Git-Native Tracking:** Metrics are always tied directly to the commit SHA that generated them.
* **Simple Reporting:** Generate static trend charts (e.g., trend lines for LOC, complexity score, etc.) accessible directly from the CI run summary.

## **üèóÔ∏è Architectural Recommendations**

*(These are the initial technology recommendations for implementation, focusing on simplicity and GitHub Action compatibility. We welcome community input on these choices\!)*

| Component | Recommendation | Why? |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Tooling Language** | **Node.js / TypeScript** | Native support for GitHub Actions, high performance, and robust tooling ecosystem. |
| **Data Storage** | **SQLite** | The gold standard for lightweight, file-based, zero-config databases. Perfect for storing historical data in an artifact file. |
| **Data Visualization** | **Chart.js or similar** | Used to generate simple, static charts embedded in an HTML file for easy artifact viewing. |
| **Packaging** | **GitHub Action (JavaScript/Container)** | The core delivery mechanism, providing a single, clean step for users' workflows. |

## **üöÄ Getting Started (Planned Usage)**

1. **Add the Action:** Include the unentropy/action@v1 step in your existing CI workflow.
2. **Configure Metrics:** Create an unentropy.yml file to define which scripts to run to generate your metrics (e.g., loc\_script: ./scripts/count\_loc.sh).
3. **Review Reports:** After the CI run, download the generated unentropy-report.html artifact to see the latest trends and track your progress against codebase entropy\!
