# **Unentropy**

**Unentropy: CI/CD Codebase Health Tracking, Decoupled.**

_(The tendency of a complex codebase to increase in disorder is known as "code entropy." Unentropy aims to reverse that trend.)_

## **üí° What is Unentropy?**

**Unentropy** is an open-source tool designed to help engineering teams maintain and improve mid-sized to large, long-living codebases by relentlessly tracking **custom code metrics** right where the changes happen: in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

Unlike monolithic tools that require dedicated servers, cloud hosting, or complex infrastructure, **Unentropy is fully self-contained within your existing GitHub Actions workflow.** It provides a lightweight, serverless solution for historical data tracking and reporting.

## **üéØ The Problem Unentropy Solves**

As codebases mature, teams need to track custom, internal metrics specific to their business logic or technological evolution. This could range from simple counts to highly specific indicators generated by custom scripts.

1. **Tracking Custom Metrics:** Standard tools often don't support the highly custom, often _ad-hoc_, metrics critical for a specific project (e.g., "Ratio of Modern Framework usage to Legacy Code").
2. **Server Overhead:** Hosting and maintaining a dedicated service (like SonarQube or custom dashboards) just to track trends is significant overhead, especially for smaller or distributed teams.
3. **Data Persistence:** You need a simple, reliable way to persist historical metrics associated with specific commits, without adding another managed service.

## **üõ†Ô∏è How Unentropy Works**

Unentropy operates entirely within a GitHub workflow using a three-action architecture that separates concerns for better maintainability:

1. **Find Database:** The `find-database` action **locates and downloads** the existing metrics database from the latest successful workflow run, handling all GitHub API interactions.
2. **Collect Metrics:** The `collect-metrics` action executes your custom metric collection scripts, gathers new data points (with Git SHA and timestamp), and adds them to the database.
3. **Generate Report:** The `generate-report` action creates a **static HTML trend report** with charts from the collected data.

Each action has a single responsibility and can be used independently or together in a workflow. The database and report are uploaded as GitHub Artifacts, making them immediately available for download and review.

This allows teams to see trends, spot entropy spikes, and visualize codebase health over time, all without maintaining a single external server.

## **‚ú® Key Features (MVP Goals)**

- **Serverless Architecture:** No server, no cloud, no recurring fees. Everything lives in your repository's workflow artifacts.
- **Custom Metric Agnostic:** Easily consume key-value metrics generated by _any_ script or custom tool you write.
- **Git-Native Tracking:** Metrics are always tied directly to the commit SHA that generated them.
- **Simple Reporting:** Generate static trend charts (e.g., trend lines for LOC, complexity score, etc.) accessible directly from the CI run summary.

## **üöÄ Getting Started**

### Basic Three-Action Workflow

Add the three Unentropy actions to your existing CI workflow:

```yaml
- name: Find latest database
  id: find-database
  uses: ./.github/actions/find-database
  with:
    database-artifact: "unentropy-metrics"
    database-path: "./unentropy-metrics.db"

- name: Collect metrics
  id: collect-metrics
  uses: ./.github/actions/collect-metrics
  with:
    config-path: "./unentropy.json"
    database-path: "./unentropy-metrics.db"

- name: Generate report
  id: generate-report
  uses: ./.github/actions/generate-report
  with:
    database-path: "./unentropy-metrics.db"
    output-path: "./unentropy-report.html"
```

### Configuration

Create an `unentropy.json` file to define your metrics:

```json
{
  "metrics": [
    {
      "name": "test_coverage",
      "command": "bun test --coverage",
      "parser": "regex",
      "pattern": "Coverage: (\\d+\\.\\d+)%",
      "unit": "%"
    },
    {
      "name": "lines_of_code",
      "command": "find src/ -name '*.ts' | wc -l",
      "parser": "raw",
      "unit": "LOC"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Review Reports

After the CI run, download the `unentropy-report.html` artifact to see the latest trends and track your progress against codebase entropy!

## **üîç Self-Monitoring Example**

Unentropy practices what it preaches - this repository uses Unentropy to track its own code health metrics! This serves as both a genuine project monitoring tool and a living example for potential users.

### Current Self-Monitoring Metrics

The `unentropy.json` file in this repository tracks:

1. **Test Coverage** (`test_coverage`)
   - **What**: Percentage of code covered by tests
   - **How**: `bun test --coverage` with parsing to extract percentage
   - **Unit**: `%`

2. **Lines of Code** (`lines_of_code`)
   - **What**: Total TypeScript lines in `src/` directory
   - **How**: `find src/ -name '*.ts' | wc -l`
   - **Unit**: `LOC`

### How It Works in This Repository

Every push and pull request to this repository automatically:

1. **Finds** the latest metrics database from previous successful runs
2. **Collects** the two metrics above using the defined commands
3. **Stores** the data in a SQLite database persisted as a GitHub Artifact
4. **Generates** an HTML report showing trends over time
5. **Uploads** both the updated database and report as artifacts

See the [`.github/workflows/metrics.yml`](.github/workflows/metrics.yml) file for the complete three-action workflow implementation.

You can see the latest reports by:

- Checking the "Artifacts" section of any GitHub Actions run
- Downloading the `metrics-report` artifact
- Opening the `unentropy-report.html` file in your browser
